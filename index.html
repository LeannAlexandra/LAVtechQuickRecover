         <h2>How To Guide</h2>
         <ul id="center-explanation">
            <li><h4>1.) Open the app</h4><img src="src-web/mainwindow.gif" alt="image of the main window"> <p>Open the App, it does require the .NET runtime. </p></li>
            <li><h4>2.) Select Input Directory</h4><img src="src-web/select-input.gif" alt="delect input gif"><p>Select the input directory, LAVTech QuickPick will run through all the folders and files and gather all the files of your chosen type to the destination folder</p></li>
            <li><h4>3.) Choose the file ypes</h4><img src="src-web/choose-filetypes.gif" alt="choose file types gif"><p>Choose your file types you wish gather into one folder quickly.</p></li>
            <li><h4>4.) Choose Destination Folder</h4><img src="src-web/select-destination.gif" alt="choose your destination folder gif"><p>Choose your destination drive, for best result it is advised not to chose the same drive you're copying from, so far no errors have been logged when using it on the same usb - Wouldn't recommenend doing it with a full drive as the full extent of the limitations is not tested.</p></li>
            <li><h4>5.) Preserve Folder Structure (Optional)</h4><img src="src-web/preserve-folderstructure.gif" alt="choose preserve folderstructure"><p>If you want to preserve the folder structure, choose it here, if you want all your music just thrown into the same folder, this is advised to be off. if you know your music to be structured, you can switch it on, however there are many levels folders copied unnecessarily.</p></li>
            <li><h4>6.) Give your newly herded files a unique name</h4><img src="src-web/rename-target-folder.gif" alt="rename your custom destination folder"><p>Give your output folder a name, this ensures that you know what is in it, for example copying documents to 'REC DOCS' and music to another folder 'REC MUSIC' to keep them seperate</p></li>
            <li><h4>7.) Click Copy and wait</h4><img src="src-web/let-it-rip.gif" alt=""> <p>Let it copy, once the coping is complete the exit button will become available again.</p></li>

                <li>TreeView: To select a specific input folder as opposed to the whole drive.</li>
                <li>Smarter: Auto-skip such as skipping all of the 'appdata' folder should you use it to retain a user's files and folders for a new computer with familiar files in all the familiar places.</li>

        <h2>How To:</h2>
        <p>Windows: To run the app, download the LAVTechQuickRecover.exe and run it.</p>
        <p>The application automatically reads and indexes the available permanent drives and removable drives (usb) defaults to E:/ (primarily flash drive/secondary storage). The program runs through all folders seeking the files with the predefined extentions and copies them to one folder. There is an option to preserve the folder structure, if you wish.
        </p>

    <div class="limitations">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Does not copy duplicates based on name - does not rename duplicates: 
                <ul><li>Idea: compare ELF header, and copy & rename only when file is clear duplicate.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>does not automatically understand GIT and programming<span class="description-elaboration"> - I don't anticipte too much use - apart from true offline application thereoff</span></li>
            <li>Input is currently limited to a whole drive - small fix if needed</li>
            <li></li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm LeAnn Alexandra, but I go by Alexandra, because it is slightly less likely to be misspelled. I resigned my steady position as General Manager with a FMCG Company in early 2023 to pursue a carreer in software and programming. To make something work flawlessly is not enough for me, I am driven by my need to understand every minor voltage shift inside the hardware.</p>
